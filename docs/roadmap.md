## 1. Introduction

Our Next.js application([1](https://nextjs.org/docs)) leverages Prisma as an ORM, PostgreSQL as the primary database, and a custom data model for storing user information, folders, documents, and legal cases. The application also incorporates AI-based features to assist users in document analysis and management.

---

## 2. Current Features

1. User Authentication & Authorization  
   - Built with NextAuth and Prisma adapter.  
   - Users can sign in, sign out, and manage their sessions.

2. Case Management  
   - Create, read, update, and delete legal cases.  
   - Assign documents, notes, and tasks to cases.

3. Document Management  
   - File uploads and organization in folders (including nested folders).  
   - Document storage using Cloudflare R2.
   - Basic AI integration for document analysis.

4. Tasks & Notes  
   - Track tasks (e.g., TODO, IN_PROGRESS) and notes linked to specific cases.  
   - Store additional data (due dates, statuses) using relational tables in Prisma.

5. AI Chat Integration  
   - Simple AI-based chat to help with legal queries related to the documents.

---

## 3. Short-Term Goals

1. Refine Folder Management  
   - Improve folder navigation and sorting.  
   - Add search within folders and quick folder actions.

2. Enhanced Document Search  
   - Incorporate more robust text extraction for PDFs and Word documents.  
   - Extend AI-based document insights with advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP).

3. AI Chat Improvements  
   - Context-aware chat that references specific case or document context.  
   - Ability to summarize large documents quickly.

4. User Experience (UX) Cleanup  
   - Streamline UI for creating new cases, uploading documents, and adding tasks.  
   - Improve layout with Next.js built-in optimizations([2](https://nextjs.org/conf/session/ama-nextjs-team)).

5. Continuous Integration (CI) Setup  
   - Implement basic CI using GitHub Actions (e.g., linting, type-checking, and testing).

---

## 4. Mid-Term Goals

1. Calendar & Scheduling  
   - Integrate a calendar for case deadlines, tasks due dates, and scheduling reminders.

2. Sharing & Collaboration  
   - Allow selective sharing of documents with external collaborators.  
   - Maintain access logs and advanced permission roles (e.g., read-only, comment-only).

3. Advanced AI Features  
   - Automated entity extraction and case linking based on content (e.g., linking Party entities in documents).  
   - Intelligent suggestions to group documents by tags or categories.

4. Reporting & Analytics  
   - Dashboard for high-level metrics on case progress, document usage, and tasks.  
   - Exportable reports for stakeholder reviews.

5. Offline Support & Notifications  
   - Enable push notifications around task updates or new document uploads.  
   - Look into caching strategies, especially for read access to case files offline.

---

## 5. Long-Term Goals

1. E-Signatures  
   - Collaborate with third-party APIs for document signing workflows.

2. Integrating External DMS or CRMs  
   - Provide integrations with popular platforms (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot) for seamless data sync.

3. Full Audit Trail & Compliance  
   - Detailed version history for documents and notes.  
   - Enhanced compliance logging (HIPAA, GDPR, or similar, depending on your target industries).

4. Multi-Tenancy Support  
   - Allow organizational accounts with multiple users, role-based permissions, and data isolations at the org level.

5. Extensible AI Pipeline  
   - Provide a plugin architecture for adding specialized AI or domain-specific models.

---

## 6. Production Deployment Plan

1. Environment Configuration  
   - Ensure environment variables for DATABASE_URL, security secrets, Cloudflare R2 credentials, etc. are set properly.

2. Testing & QA  
   - Write comprehensive test suites for all major operations (cases, documents, tasks, etc.).  
   - Include AI-related tests for basic functionality and performance.

3. Logging & Monitoring  
   - Integrate a logging solution (e.g., DataDog, Grafana, or similar) for errors and performance metrics.  
   - Implement Next.js recommended best practices for error handling and user-friendly error pages([3](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing)).

4. Containerization & Scalability  
   - Containerize the application with Docker for consistent deployments.  
   - Use a PaaS or container orchestration solution (e.g., Vercel, AWS ECS) to run at scale.

5. Database Migrations & Backups  
   - Schedule regular backups for PostgreSQL.  
   - Manage Prisma migrations in a CI/CD pipeline to ensure schema consistency across environments([4](https://www.prisma.io/docs)).

6. Security & Access Controls  
   - Harden authentication with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in NextAuth if needed.  
   - Enable HTTPS (TLS certificates) in production.

7. Performance Optimization  
   - Leverage Next.js features such as dynamic HTML streaming and caching strategies inside the App Router for faster rendering([5](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app)).  
   - Use a CDN (e.g., Cloudflare) to offload static assets and reduce latency.
